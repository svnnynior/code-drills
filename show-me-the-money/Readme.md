# Show Me The Money

[!NOTE]
For the instructions on how to run the project, please read [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md).

The goal of the project is to build a simple one page application to display the Balance Sheet Report from [Xero](https://www.xero.com/au/).

Please read through the API documentation at https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/reports#balance-sheet.

Use mock Xero Balance Sheet API docker image available at https://hub.docker.com/r/jaypeng2015/show-me-the-money.

The Server runs on http with port 3000, and the api path is `/api.xro/2.0/Reports/BalanceSheet` once you have it running.

The system should consist of the following:

- Backend - Any typed Language (except Java)

  - Assume that the authentication with Xero is already done.
  - Provide API endpoint to get data from Xero API for the frontend to use.
  - Consider error handling.
  - Consider unit tests.

- Frontend - Typescript + React
  - Display the results in a table based on the data structure return from Xero.
  - Consider unit tests.

Consider containerise your solution.
